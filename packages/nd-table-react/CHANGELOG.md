# Changelog

## v3.0.2

- Added export for React-Table defaultProps object so that we can access internal React-Table components

## v3.0.1

- removed sort icons generated by css in v3.0.0

## v3.0.0 (2021-02-19)

### Breaking

- Changed sort style to use @ndustrial/nd-icons-svg arrow-up/arrow-down svg's instead of box-shadow. As users can define arbitrary header components, this may require some additional styling on the user's end to align the icon depending on the users current implementation and needs.
